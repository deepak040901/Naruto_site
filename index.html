       <p>After nearly every ninja in Konoha comes together to try and take on Pain, it ultimately comes down to a passionate one-on-one battle in which Naruto defeats him with a combination of Sage Mode, Rasengan, and Shadow Clones. Rather than crush him completely, Naruto empathizes with him - which leads to Pain reviving everyone in Konoha who passed away during his attacks.
        Using his newly learned senjutsu techniques and a perfected Wind Release: Rasenshuriken, Naruto saved Tsunade and handily defeated the Asura, Human, Animal, and Naraka Paths, before the Deva Path regained enough strength to fight on its own again. When he was finally caught and held by the energy-absorbing Preta Path, Naruto used the senjutsu chakra to disrupt the Preta Path's chakra flow, turning it into a frog statue, before finally facing the Deva Path, Pain's last and most often used body.
       <br>,<br>
        While still being pursued by the Nine-Tails, Pain, through the great strain of Nagato, used the Chibaku Tensei to create a giant miniature moon in an attempt to capture the Nine-Tails. During this time, Naruto, locked in his own subconscious and lost in despair, called out for help to a response of Pain's visions of peace. In the end, while the apparently evil Pain had a plan to deal with the hatred in the world, Naruto did not. Taking advantage of his pain, the Nine-Tails convinced Naruto to destroy everything in the world by releasing the seal. This caused the seal to distort. Despite the strength of the miniature moon, the distorted seal allowed the eighth-tail to grow, partially breaking free of the sphere.,<br><br>

In his mind, just as he was about to remove the seal to release the ninth tail, Minato Namikaze, the Fourth Hokage, appeared, and spoke with Naruto. Minato revealed to Naruto that he was his father, and he sealed the Nine-Tails into him because he too felt that the Nine-Tails was forced to come to Konoha, and believed a masked being within Akatsuki was behind the attack. After easing Naruto's fears that he couldn't change the world, Minato repaired the seal and sent Naruto back to finish his battle with Pain.<br><br>

With the Nine-Tails' chakra suppressed, Naruto and Pain resumed their battle, with Naruto tricking Pain into using a Shinra Tensei on dozens of shadow clones, giving Naruto enough time to strike him with a Rasengan during the five second window. The last body of Pain was defeated, and Naruto used its black receivers to track down and confront Nagato himself.

       <p>At the Valley of the End, Naruto recalls Neji's words about Sasuke being in darkness. Sasuke explains that based on Itachi's life, he's come to the conclusion that a true Hokage is one who shoulders the hatred of others. Sasuke intends to concentrate all power and all hatred on himself. 
           <br><br>
           Naruto points out others would not agree with his plan, but Sasuke doesn't care. Sasuke is certain he has all the power he needs to carry out his plan. Naruto argues there are things that can't be done alone, like the fight against Kaguya. By killing the tailed beasts and the Kage, Sasuke wants to erase the darkness of the past. Naruto denounces erasing the past, having been shaped by his past as well. Hagoromo begins fading away, and tells Kakashi to keep having faith. Thinking of their answers, Hagoromo fades. Naruto and Sasuke begin fighting, first with taijutsu. Sasuke attacks with fireballs, which Naruto dodges. Naruto creates clones, which attack with Rasengan. Using the Rinnegan, Sasuke pulls Naruto and his clones toward himself, and skewers them with black flames. 
           <br><br>
           The real Naruto blocks it with chakra arms, and attacks Sasuke from above with more arms. Entering Six Paths Sage Mode, Naruto continues attacking with chakra arms. Sasuke sends another fireball his way, which Naruto blocks. Sasuke teleports behind Naruto, and sends him back with Chidori. Sasuke begins firing Susanoo arrows, which Naruto blocks with his Truth-Seeking Balls. Sasuke switches to a Complete Body Susanoo, and Naruto enters Tailed Beast Mode just in time to parry Sasuke's attack, fist-bumping him in the process. The two see each other's loneliness as children. Sasuke has Susanoo blow fireballs at Naruto, who dodges them, blocks Susanoo's swords with Kurama's tails, and tosses Susanoo down with them. Naruto hesitates using a Tailed Beast Ball when Susanoo is down, giving Sasuke an opportunity of using Kirin. Sasuke chastises Naruto for stalling. Naruto refuses to let Sasuke go alone again. 
           <br><br>
           The two clash with a Susanoo: Chidori and a Tailed Beast Ball. In each other's minds again, Sasuke expresses the need to kill Naruto. Naruto points out there's no guarantee the world Sasuke creates won't have the same darkness as before, and that the five villages are finally united at peace. Sasuke argues the only reason that happened is because were forced to band together to defeat common enemies in Akatsuki, Madara, and Kaguya. Naruto asks what happens after Sasuke dies, no longer fulfilling the role of common enemy. Sasuke answers that with the power of the Rinnegan, he has many ways of leading from the shadows. Still annoyed at Naruto's insistence in not killing him, Sasuke calls forth the Chibaku Tensei the tailed beasts are sealed in, in his first step into the shadows.

       <p>Upon reaching Sasuke (who was unconscious), Orochimaru and his team finds him with Kabuto who’s chakra signature they could not recognize.  Kabuto explains that he has decided to save injured Sasuke after coming to realize who he was.
       <br><br>
       Elsewhere, Guy joins Kakashi and his group in the battle against Madara. Minato explains to Guy that only Senjutsu and Taijutsu will work against Madara. In response Guy Leaps forward to Madara and enters the Seventh Gate formation dubbed “The Blue Beast”.  Guy engages Madara in a fight; however Madara proved to be too strong for him.
       <br><br>
       Shortly after his encounter, the episode goes on a flash-back of Guy’s past with his father Might Duy. In the flash-back, Guy remembers how he failed to graduate and how his father was mocked by older ninja. The episode ends during this flash back where Kakashi saves Guy from two older ninja who were beating up Guy and mocking his father Duy.
       <br><br>
       Because Madara is immune to ninjutsu, few people are actually able to take him on. Gai, a taijutsu master who is capable of opening the Eight Gates, goes head to head with him in an epic battle that pushes both combatants to the limit.

       <p>Sasuke arrived at the Uchiha Hideout, and confronted Itachi. The battle began with both of them seemingly using taijutsu, soon ending with Sasuke cornering Itachi and deciding to ask him one last question before killing him off. Sasuke asked, "Who is he?" Sasuke recalled when Itachi had said that three of the Uchiha clan would have the ability to use the Mangekyō Sharingan, including himself, if Sasuke would be able to awaken his. 
           <br><br>
           Itachi explained that the person who had assisted him when he murdered the entire clan was none other than Madara Uchiha, one of the founders of Konoha, and revealed that one of the purposes of the Mangekyō Sharingan was to control the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox which he had done 16 years ago when it attacked Konoha. He also revealed that, once the Mangekyō Sharingan was activated, it would progressively lead to blindness. After a flashback of his childhood, Sasuke stated, "Finally… it all ends here." During their talk, Zetsu watched hidden from the ceiling, and his halves began to comment on the battle.
           <br><br>

        Sasuke shortly lectured Itachi about the tools of the ninja, and how a tool was only as powerful as the ninja who used it. Itachi told Sasuke that he would make his dream, of ripping out his eyes, a reality, and readied the Amaterasu. Itachi and Sasuke both used the Great Fireball Technique, and Sasuke held a slight advantage until Itachi used Amaterasu, which burnt out Sasuke's fireball immediately, and melted through his remaining cursed seal level 2 wing, as well as scorching his body. Itachi prepared to rip the eyes out of the half-burned Sasuke, but the corpse was shown to be an empty shell left behind, and the real Sasuke had dropped into the floor below. He used a new ninjutsu, named Fire Release: Great Dragon Fire Technique, from down below. Itachi dodged, but it still burnt his arm. Soon it began to rain, and Sasuke said that this new technique was unavoidable. Zetsu continued watching the fight, narrating their movements and adding background to mysterious moves.
        <br><br>

Itachi then asked Sasuke if that was all he had. Sasuke then proceeded to attack Itachi, again ending in a futile attempt as all his attacks were reflected by another effect of Susanoo, the Yata Mirror, which reflected all attacks directed at Itachi. Sasuke was knocked back by his own attacks, and laid on the ground. Itachi seemed to be invincible, when Susanoo began to fade. Itachi walked towards his brother, seeking his eyes. When Itachi reached Sasuke, he poked Sasuke's forehead, saying, "I'm sorry, Sasuke. There won't be a next time", a reference to his constant unfulfilled promises to train with Sasuke in their youth. Itachi then died of exhaustion. Zetsu figured that Itachi must have been injured before the battle started, also noting that Itachi was unable to dodge attacks he would normally be able to. Sasuke then smiled and closed his eyes before collapsing himself, as Itachi's Amaterasu continued to burn around them.
